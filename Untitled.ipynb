    "Looking at above histogram we can see that most of the values lie around the mean (around 70 inches). As we move away from the mean on both directions, the frequency of observations reduce creating two tails at both ends. The red line above shows a \"**Probability Density**\" function, as compared to Probability functions we saw with cdf and pmf. A Probability Density Function (pdf) helps identify the regions in the distribution where observations are more likely to occur. So for the distribution above, the mean region has a high probability density as compared to tails. This is an example of a **Normal Distribution** which we shall look at next. \n",

    "Probability functions are great for figuring out **intervals** because as shown above, it is hard to identify an exact point. a height of 6 feet is actually considered interval between say 5.99 feet and 6.01 feet which makes it an interval for dealing with the continuous variable. So we have to be careful when reading probability density function graphs, especially when it comes to exact numbers. For heights, What about the probability any person will weigh exactly 6 feet? Written in notation, the question would be:\n",

    "Looking at the graph, you might think that the probability of a person having height of exactly six feet it 0.05 or 5%, but this not accurate. The idea that 5% of people are exactly 6 ft tall is not acceptable. Heights would differ in terms of millimeters, micrometers or even nanometers. the person could be 6.00012 or 5.99987 feet tall. In fact, the probability of someone being exactly 6ft is so tiny. it’s practically zero.\n",
